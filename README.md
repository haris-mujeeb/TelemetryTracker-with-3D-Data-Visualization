TelemetryTracker is a technical project designed to collect and visualize telemetry data using the ESP32-S3 Feather (Adafruit #5477) as the central microcontroller. The system integrates the following components:
MPU9250 (9DOF) IMU
ZOE-M8Q GPS Module
Tekscan FlexiForce A201 pressure sensor
3D Visualization of the collected telemetry data, allowing for in-depth analysis of spatial and pressure dynamics.
